#' This function calculates game score using the USA Ultimate Rankings Algorithm.
#' Then, it determines the ratings changes as a result of that game outcome.
#' Unlike its counterpart, calculate_game_score_adjusted, it takes team names â€” not ratings â€” as inputs.
#' Then, it pulls that team's most updated rating from the rankings site and calculates the results.
#' Returns a dataframe with information.
#' @param winner_team The name of the winning team.
#' @param loser_team The name of the losing team.
#' @param winner_score The score of the winning team.
#' @param loser_score The score of the losing team.
#' @param league_type The league type of the game. Should be equal to "mens" for men's games and "womens" for women's games. Other values will return an error.
