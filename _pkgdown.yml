#### Assignment 00, STAT 3250#### This assignment is for practice only, the score will not be used.## Two *very* important rules that must be followed in order for your assignment## to be graded correctly:#### a) The Python file name must be exactly "assignment00.py" (without the quotes)## b) The variable names q1, q2, ... must not be changed.  These variable ##    names should not be used anywhere else in your file.  Do not delete these##    variables. If you don't know how to find a value for a variable, just  ##    leave the corresponding variable with "= None". (If any variable is     ##    missing the autograder will not grade your assignment.)## When you answer each question, replace the "..." to the right of the equals## sign with code or the correct value.## Question 1#### Find the sum of 23 and 119 by computing 23 + 119 on the right belowq1 = 23 + 119## Question 2#### Create a list with 16 as the first element and 29 as the second ## element by typing [16, 29] on the right below.q2 = [16,29]  ## Question 3#### Create a list with "Hello" as the first element and "World" as the second ## element.q3 = ["Hello","World"]
